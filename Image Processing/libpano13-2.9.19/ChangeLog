2011-03-04    <dmg@uvic.ca>

	* .hgignore: Added some files. Sorted files, so it is easier to
	merge when the time comes.

2011-03-03    <dmg@uvic.ca>

	* CMakeList.txt: Added TAGS file creation, undid removal of
	hugin-related paths.

2011-03-02    <dmg@uvic.ca>

	* panotypes.h, and many other files: Removed pt_int* data
	types. There are not used consistently with the uint datatypes, so
	why add confusion?

	* tests/CMakeLists.txt: I removed some code that
	moved/copied/removed the test data files in the reference directory.

	* panorama.h: We no longer need code for OS 9. We don't support
	it. Cleaned up the file.

	* filter.h, sys_common.c (dieWithError): Removed const as it just
	adds compiler warnings, and we don't really use const parameters
	anyways.

	* sys_ansi.c: Cleaned up the file from compiler warnings.

	* pt_stdint.h: Cleaned up this file.

	* panotypes.h: Cleaned up this file. 

2011-02-20    <dmg@uvic.ca>

	* tools/panoinfo_unix.c, sys_ansy.c: removed compiler
	warnings. Patch submited by Guillaume Rousse.

2011-01-20    <pablo.dangelo@web.de>

	* parser.c: disabled debug printf in parsing code

2011-01-11    jim0watters

	* adjust.c Update SetStitchDefaults to include psdOpacity and psdBlendingMode

	* version.h, pano13.rc Update version description to indicate if build is
	32 or 64 bit
  
2011-01-06    <dmg@uvic.ca>

	* PTcommon.c (Clear_Area_Outside_Selected_Region): thoby should
	crop as a circular fisheye, not a rectangular region when using
	the S parameter.

	* configure.ac, version.h: Moved to version 2.9.18

2011-01-05    <dmg@uvic.ca>

	* queryfeature.c: Added data for thoby projection. Patch by
	T. Modes.

	* dump.c: removed unused variables. Patch by T. Modes.
	
2011-01-05    <dmg@uvic.ca>

	* parser.c (ParseScript): Removed a bogus statement added during
	debugging.

	* PTcommon.c: Added debugging code to verify how stable the
	transformations are.
	
	* doc/stitch.txt: updated for new projection.
	
	* dump.c, dump.f: Functions to dump the contents of internal
	variables (for debugging purposes)

	* math.c (thoby_sphere_tp, sphere_tp_thoby), adjust.c, parser.c,
	filter.h, panorama.h: implemented Michel Thoby projection for
	Nikkor 10.5, which is called Thoby Projection, and number 20.

2010-04-27  dmg  <dmg@uvic.ca>

	* jpeg.c: Removed dependency from file which was braking  build
	for some Windows people. The change seems to be harmless under
	Linux. Reported by  Volker Grabsch.

2010-03-28  dmg  <dmg@uvic.ca>

	* math.c, adjust.c, parser.c: enabled other input projections, in
	particular: stereographic and equisolid (which is really lambert
	equal area). We need to clean up a lot of the code from math.c,
	because there are redundant functions. 


2010-01-29  dmg  <dmg@Iridium.local>

	* version.h, configure.ac: bumped version to 2.9.17

2010-01-29  dmg  <dmg@uvic.ca>

	* parser.c (ReadImageDescription): Expanded patch by Pablo to
	avoid Translation processing when T[xyz] parms=0 are added to the
	line.	 I hate our parser.


2010-01-17  dmg  <dmg@uvic.ca>

	* configure.ac, version.h: Updated version number to 2.9.16

	* Makefile.am: Added new panini source code files to the building
	of the library.

2010-01-09  dmg  <dmg@uvic.ca>

	* queryfeature.c (panoProjectionFormatCount): Fix for one the
	problem with the type of the pointer. This was a big error I
	introduced some time ago. This code removes the hard coded data
	type. 

2010-01-08  dmg  <dmg@uvic.ca>

	* math.c: Reviewed and reformatted code by Tom for his implementation
	of the panini general.

2010-01-03  dmg  <dmg@uvic.ca>

	* Pablo fixed the bug in which, if a Tr[xyz] was present, the
	Translation operation was executed, even if the parms were
	zero. This restricted the FOV to 180 degrees, regardless of
	projection.

2010-01-01  dmg  <dmg@uvic.ca>

	* math.c (panini_general_erect): Fixed minor  typing  error when
	implementing the formulae.

	* queryfeature.c (panoProjectionFeaturesQuery): Cleaned up the
	general panini parameters.

2009-12-27  dmg  <dmg@uvic.ca>

	* queryfeature.c: Yesterday I forgot to add the name of the
	projection. This patch fixes that. Fixes bug 2921848. Removed
	sizes from 



2009-12-26  dmg  <dmg@uvic.ca>

	* queryfeature.c, parser.c, panorama.h, filter.h, math.c,
	adjust.c: Added general form of panini general projection. It
	takes one parameter: the distance factor, any possitive
	number. Math by Tom Sharpless.
	
2009-10-11 dangelo

	* filter.h, math.c: Use Te0 as plane_yaw and Te1 as
	plane_pitch. This allows specification of the plane that is used in
	the translation mosaic (TrX, TrY, TrZ) mode. Not sure if the code is
	bug free, though. It mostly worked as expected but didn't work nicely
	for the nadir usecase in my limited tests.

2009-10-07 jim0watters

    * PTmender.c: use define for path seperator.

	* ColourBrightness.c, file.c, hdrfile.c, main.c, parser.c, PTcommon.c, 
	ptstitch.c, tiff.c pttiff.h: Fixed many possible memory leaks for libpano
	
	* PTblender.c, PTmasker.c, PTmender.h, PTroller.c: Fixed many possible 
	memory leaks for the tools.
	
2009-09-26    <dmg@uvic.ca>

	* adjust.c (SetAlignParams): Trying to normalize the angles didn't
	really worked. Disabled for the time begin

	* filter.h (NORM_ANGLE_RAD): Totally incorrect implementation before.



2009-09-25    <dmg@uvic.ca>

	* parser.c (ReadImageDescription): Removed a debugging printf I forgot

	* adjust.c (SetAlignParams): Added new variables and renamed tilt ones.
	(panoAdjustPrintMakeParams): Renamed function to make it standard.
	Renamed variable g to optInfo
	(SetAlignParams): Make sure the tilt parameters never go outside
	incorrect values.

	* parser.c (panoParseVariable, ParseScript): Refactored some
	code. Sorry but I had to reindent the entire function.

	* parser.c (WriteResults): Added new parameters to the output.

	* parser.c (ParseScript): Renamed Tx, Ty,
	and Tz to TiX, TiY, and TiZ. Added translation variables TrX, TxY,
	and TrZ and test ones Te0, Te1, Te2, Te3.

	* filter.h: Added translation parameters, (trans[XYZ]), renamed
	optimization variables to a more meaningful name (suffix optVar),
	added a new set of variables for testing new functions in the
	stack.

2009-09-20 21:08  dangelo

	* adjust.c, panorama.h, filter.h, math.c: Mosaic mode based on

	  Patch submitted by Kornel Benko
	  
	  * ptpicker.c: Casted some values in printf to avoid compiler
	  warnings.
	  
	  * CMakeLists.txt: As allways one has to call cmake
	  -DCPACK_BINARY_DEB:BOOL=ON to create a package (debian/ubuntu in
	  this example)
	  
	  make package creates then the package libpano13-2.9.15-Linux.deb.

2009-02-04 23:02  brunopostle

	* parser.c: four variables have been added to "C" lines:
	  * c - control point number;
	  * D, Dx, Dy - a control point error (value and orthogonal
	  components).
	  It is useful for the analysis of results of PToptimizer operation

	  subsequent removal of "bad" control points. Patch #2118807 (Iouri
	  Ivliev)

2009-02-04 22:33  brunopostle

	* parser.c: Existing implementation of WriteResults function uses
	  two intermediate buffers
	  for sprintf(3) and a considerable quantity of strcat(3) calls for
	  copying data
	  in the target buffer. This patch removes all strcat(3) calls and
	  fulfils
	  sprintf(3) in the target buffer directly. Patch #2118807 (Iouri
	  Ivliev)

2009-02-02 21:55  dangelo

	* version.h (VERSION), configure.ac Upgraded to version 2.9.2.

	* TODO: Updated it.
	
	* tools/PTmender.c: Mimic processing of input filenames to match

	not done correctly for circular fisheye images (CFIs). For the
	time being we will do uncrop processing for CFIs, and cropped
	processing for everything else. For fisheyes we will create crops
	in post-processing (it is a hack, but it means everything is
	consistent).
	
	* tools/PTroller.c (main): Fixed a warning

	commented it out)

	* parser.c (ReadImageDescription): Croping options  were not
	working properly when 2 cropping specs were specified in the same
	command line. For instance, when M=0 was specified any cropping on
	the image was considered a type C crop. The new behaviour is the
	following:

	if M is specified with parameter == 0, then it is ignored

	For project with two different types of cropping (M<>0, S or C)
	the first takes precedence over the second, and a warning is
	displayed.

2006-10-25  dmg  <dmg@uvic.ca>

	* version.h (VERSION), configure.ac: Upgraded to version 2.8.5pre7

	* ColourBrightness.c (ReadHistograms): Compute histograms only
	when mask == 255. Ignore otherwise.

	correction) were not properly created in Intel machines. 

	Submitted by Michal at lightcomp.
	
	* tools/PTblender.c: Updated command line processing: assume image
	0 as reference if options -m or -c are specified.
	

2006-10-24  dmg  <dmg@uvic.ca>

	* version.h (VERSION), configure.ac: Upgraded to version 2.8.5pre5

	* ColourBrightness.c, tools/PTblender.c: The following bugs in PTblender
	are fixed:
	
	1) When -c or -m is specified no image output is done and therefore it 
	should not be possible to specify -f too.
	2) When -c is specified wrong index to array curveExtension is used.
	3) Program tries to free already freed memory at the end.

	Submitted by Michal at lightcomp.

	We need a test suite for PTblender.
	
2006-10-22  dmg  <dmg@uvic.ca>

	* version.h (VERSION), configure.ac: Upgraded to version 2.8.5pre4

	* tiff.c: Removed redundant #defines

	* PTcommon.c, PTcommon.h, filter.h, file.c: Added support for
	stacking images in PSD files, that is, each iamge contributes
	equaly to a final image.

2006-09-22  dmg  <dmg@uvic.ca>

	* ptstitch.c: The creation of the stitching masks was not working
	in certain cases (a combination of output format + number of
	images, and the use of cropped files). This change fixes that problem.

2006-09-21  dmg  <dmg@uvic.ca>

	* version.h (VERSION), configure.ac: Upgraded to version 2.8.5pre3

	* ColourBrightness.c, PTcommon.c: added support for
	saturation-only and brightness-only correction. I also fixed some
	small rounding problems in the old code.

2006-09-21  dmg  <dmg@uvic.ca>

	* bootstrap (have_autoconf): Added support for autoconf 2.6

	* PTcommon.c (getROI): Replace calls to _nan() with nan()

	by Florian Merz


2006-08-30  dmg  <dmg@uvic.ca>

	* file.c: Added code to start to include metadata in PSD file. So
	far only 2 bits of information are added: ICC Profile and creator
	software. Photoshop does not display the IPTC originating program,
	hence I resorted to use the "Source IPTC" tag.

2006-08-12  dmg  <dmg@iridium.dmg>

	* ptstitch.c, ptstitch.h, PTcommon.c: moved all the functions
	related to stitching into the ptstich files. Renamed the functions
	according to new standard
	(panoStitchComputeMaskMap): Unified 8bit and 16bit versions into 1
	function, and refactored most of the code to improve readability
	and maintainability. In the process I found a major bug that was
	probably affecting spherical panoramas.

2006-08-05  dmg  <dmgerman@uvic.ca>

	* version.h, configure.ac: Updated version to 2.8.5pre2

	* jpeg.c: Implemented reading and writing ICC profile data.

	* jpegicc.c, jpegicc.h, Makefile.am: I incorporated these two
	files from the LCMS project. Marti Maria, the original author, has
	granted us permission to change the license from MIT to GPL. These
	routines implement reading and writing of JPEG ICC profiles.


2006-07-30  dmg  <dmgerman@uvic.ca>

	* Makefile.am: Updated it with the new files (metadata.*
	
	* pteditor.c, morpher.c, PTpano.c, PTcommon.c, tiff.c: Replaced
	calls to readImage with calls to panoReadImage and makeTempPath to
	panoFileMakeTemp.

	* tiff.c, pttiff.h: moved panoCreatePanorama, Enabled tifferror
	handlers again for non windows.

	* jpeg.c (panoJPEGRead): Renamed it from panoReadJPEG to be consistent.

	* tiff.c: moved panoUnCropMetadata out of it
	
	* metadata.c, metadata.h: Added file with metadata only functions.
	(panoUnCropMetadata): Moved this function from tiff.c

	* hdrfile.c (panoHDRRead): Added function to support metadata

	* png.c (panoPNGRead): Added function to support metadata

	* bmp.c (panoReadBMP): Added function to support metadata

	* file.c: unified imageRead and makeTempPath into panoImageRead,
	panoMakeTempPath and moved them into this file (there exist one
	version for windows and one for unix)
	

2006-07-30  dmg  <dmgerman@uvic.ca>

	* ppm.c (readImage): I forgot to enable the PPM functions.

2006-07-28  dmg  <dmgerman@uvic.ca>


	* configure.ac: Added tests/simpleTiff16/Makefile

	* PTcommon.c (CreateAlphaChannels): Fixed bug (I never
	initialized a variable with the length of hte line)

	* configure.ac,	version.h: Bumped version to 2.8.5pre1 

	* pict.c (makeTempPath), ppm.c (makeTempPath), bmp.c
	(makeTempPath): libpano can now create more than 1000 temporal
	files. 

	* ppm.c (panoUpdateMetadataFromPPM): Updated PPM support for new
	metadata processing.

	* PTcommon.c: Improved output of progress indicators (fixed some
	minor mistakes)

	* jpeg.c, tiff.c, PTcommon.c, filter.c: Updated indentation according to
	new standard, and I removed debug messages.

2006-07-09  dmg  <dmgerman@uvic.ca>

	* panorama.h, PTcommon.c, pttiff.h, filter.c, tiff.c, filter.h,
	jpeg.c, ppm.c: Panotool is now able to preserve some metadata from
	beginning to end of the process. Only TIFF is currently
	supported. PPM is not yet supported.
	
	* ColourBrightness.c (OutputPhotoshopArbitraryMap): Removed unused variable.

	* filter.c: Set defaults for image.metadata.
	(panoSetMetadataDefaults): Added fuction that sets defauls for
	Image. Changed compression default from PACKBITS to DEFLATE
	(which creates smaller TIFFs)

	* tiff.c, jpeg.c, ppm.c, panorama.h, PTcommon.c: Reindented using
	Apache's code style.

2006-07-08  dmg  <dmgerman@uvic.ca>

	* PTcommon.c, PTcommon.h: Major refactoring of the TIFF logic. I
	have tried to encapsulate all the metadata of TIFFs including
	cropped logic. I also renamed a lot of the functions.

	* PTcommon.h, ColourBrightness.c: Updated files accordingly.

2006-06-30    <dmgerman@uvic.ca>

	* This entry marks the first commit using subversion

2006-06-25  dmg  <dmgerman@uvic.ca>

	* ColourBrightness.c (ColourBrightness, OutputCurves,
	OutputPhotoshopArbitraryMap, OutputPhotoshopCurve): Implemented
	Photoshop arbitrary map .amp.
	
	* ColourBrightness.h: Last parameter to ColourBrightness specifies
	the type of format to output (.amp or .acv)

2006-06-25  dmg  <dmgerman@uvic.ca>
	
	* ColourBrightness.c (OutputPhotoshopCurve)
	(OutputEmptyPhotoshopCurve, OutputCurves, ColourBrightness):
	Implemented the ability to output a photoshop .acv file that can
	be loaded into a curves layer. It required to add an extra
	parameter to ColourBrightness

	* ColourBrightness.h: Updated prototype. 
	
	* PTcommon.c (CreatePanorama): 	Updated call to ColourBrightness
	
	
2006-06-16  dmg  <dmgerman@uvic.ca>

	* PTcommon.c (CreatePanorama): The process for creating PSD_mask
	and PSD_nomask was inverted.

2006-06-15  dmg  <dmgerman@uvic.ca>

	* PTcommon.c: Major reindent, removed tabs.

	* ppm.c (makeTempPath): Added zeroes to temp files, so they are
	nicely sorted when listed.

	* panorama.h: Added crop info to Image data structure.

	* tiff.c (writeTIFF): Added cropInformation parameter to function
	call.
	(setCropInformationInTiff, getCropInformationFromTiff): Moved
	functions to this file from PTcommon.c

2006-06-14  Bruno Postle <bruno@postle.net>

	* Makefile.am, tests/simpleStitch/Makefile.am: put tests in tarball,
	but only run them with 'make check'.

2006-06-13  Max Lyons <maxlyons@tawbaware.com>

	* filter.h, sys_common.c, pano12.def, libpano12.def: Adding new dieWithError 
	function to print error message and exit program with non-zero exit code

	* PTCommon.c: Modifying getROI function to better calculate ROI for images 
	in projects with 360/180 FOV.  Not sure if this completely eliminates 
	problems, but is certainly a step in the right direction.

	* PTCommon.c: Adding error checking to setCropInformationInTiff function.
	
	* PTCommon.c: Removing check for cropped TIFF in uncropTIFF...it is possible 
	for a cropped TIFF to have x and y offset equal to zero, so this check could 
	have caused problems.


2006-06-12  dmg  <dmgerman@uvic.ca>

	* PTcommon.c (tiffErrorHandler): Typecasted parameter to (char *) to
	avoid warning.
	(VerifyTiffsAreCompatible): changed sprintf to strcpy to avoid
	compiler warning.
	(CreateAlphaChannels): Added (long unsigned) to avoid compiler error.
	(BlendLayers16Bit): Changed format specifier to match type of variable.
	(FlattenTIFF): Removed unused variable.

	* PTcommon.c (VerifyTiffsAreCompatible): Uncommented TIFF error
	handlers (commented by Max few weeks ago). Wrapped it around with
	ifndef to avoid windows compilation. I have the feeling this is a
	windows issue, not a gcc.

	* PTcommon.h (ReplaceExt): Declared function, moved it from
	ColourBrightness.c to PTcommon.c

	* Makefile.am (SUBDIRS): Removed tests from the default make

	* PTcommon.c (ReplaceAlphaChannel): The images created in this
	routine were not labeled as cropped. This patch fixes the
	problem. The test case did not catch this problem. We need a
	360/180 one.

2006-06-12  Jim Watters <jwatters@photocreations.ca>

	* PTcommon.c and ColourBrightness.c exclude a bunch of include files that 
	  were not needed and did not exist on Windows. 
	* pt_stdint.h add define for INT32_MAX for Windows platform
	* libpano.vcproj updated to include ColourBrightness and PTCommon.
	
2006-06-11  dmg  <dmgerman@uvic.ca>

	* PTcommon.c: Improved the behaviour during errors. exit(-1) if
	there is an irrecoverable error.

2006-06-11    <dmgerman@uvic.ca>

	* PTcommon.c (CreatePanorama): Change extension of generated PSD
	from .PSD to .psd. Remove a temp file that was left in the cropped processing.
	
2006-06-11  Max Lyons <maxlyons@tawbaware.com>

	* ColourBrightness.c, PTcommon.c, tiff.c, filter.h, pttiff.h, 
	libpano12.def, pano12.def.  Changes to support "cropped tiff" processing 
	when using colour/brightness correction in PTMender.  Changes also allow 
	pttiff2psd to work with cropped tiff output as well.


2006-06-04  Pablo d'Angelo <pablo.dangelo@web.de>

	* ptpicker.c, PTcommon.c: Moved InsertFileName from ptpicker.c to
	PTcommon.c. This broke compilation of PTmender, when java support
	was disabled.

2006-06-04  Max Lyons <maxlyons@tawbaware.com>

	* PTMender.c: Changed behavior for input file name parsing.  If the script 
	is specified on the command line with a path (e.g. c:\some\path\myscript.txt), 
	this path was prepended to all of the image names in the script, regardless 
	of whether those image names were also specified with a full qualified path.  
	This change adds a check so that the script path is only prepended to the 
	image names if the image names don't already contain path information.

	* PTCommon.c: Fixing bug with morph-to-fit.  Memory allocated with malloc 
	was being incorrectly freed with myfree leading to random crashes.
	
2006-05-31  Max Lyons <maxlyons@tawbaware.com>

	* PTCommon.c: Fixed bug in getROI

2006-05-29  Max Lyons <maxlyons@tawbaware.com>

	* adjust.c: CheckParams: Allowing optimizer to work with new projections

	* Moving uncrop logic from ptuncrop.c to ptcommon.c.  Creating 
	uncropTiff function
	
	* Adding uncropTiff function declaration to pttiff.h
	
	* Making cropped TIFF the intermediate format for all processing, 
	regardless of output format.  Uncropped TIFFs can be generated, if needed, 
	from intermediate cropped TIFFs by calling new uncropTiff function.

2006-05-29  Max Lyons <maxlyons@tawbaware.com>

	Changes fix various compilation problems:

	* Moved declaration of three functions from ptcommon.h to new ptttiff.h file.  
	
	* Updated includes in PTcommon.c and PTuncrop.c
	
	* Updated pano12.def and libpano12.def to  include the same, latest, exports

2006-05-27  dmg  <dmgerman@uvic.ca>

	* PTcommon.c (CreatePanorama): Removed some ugly formatting I
	introduced in a recent commit
	(CreatePanorama): Fixed bug of the missing column/row introduced
	in cropped files.
	
	* PTcommon.h (TiffSetImageParameters,TiffGetImageParameters):
	Exported  these functions to be able to use them in
	PTuncrop. Added #include <tiffio.h>

2006-05-24  Max Lyons <maxlyons@tawbaware.com>

	* PTCommon.c: All logic has been reworked so that "cropped"
	TIFF files can be used throughout the stitching process for all currently 
	supported output formats.  (Cropped TIFF files are those that are just 
	large enough to contain	the remapped image, and the offset/full size 
	information is stored in the TIFF header).  Modified functions include 
	ReplaceAlphaChannel, CreateAlphaChannels, AddStitchingMasks, FlattenTIFF, 
	createPanorama.  New functions include getCropInformationFromTiff, 
	setFullSizeImageParameters.
	
	* PTCommon.c: Simplified ComputeStitchingMask8bits syntax
	
	* PTCommon.c: CreatePanorama.  Reworked logic to handle intermediate output files
	and produce final output in various formats.  Added logic that decides when
	to use cropped TIFF as intermediate format based on chosen output format.  TODO:
	this could use some tidy up, and it might be a good idea to have cropped TIFF
	as the default intermediate format for TIFF_m and TIFF_mask, and include a 
	function to "expand" the cropped TIFFs to full size when finished (if the 
	user requests non-cropped TIFF).
	
	* PTCommon.c: Reluctantly commented out calls to TIFFSetWarningHandler and 
    TIFFSetErrorHandler...these cause to GCC to abort, with a series of errors 
    about multiple definition of TIFF functions in libpano and libtiff.  
    
    * PTCommon.c: Changed title bar of progress dialog to indicate currently 
    processing image number (indexed at 1) and total images to be processed.
	
	* ColourBrightness.c, PTMender.c : changed #include syntax
	
	* file.c: writePSD, writeLayerAndMask, writeChannelData, getImageRectangle, 
	addLayer.  Reworked to handle "cropped" files.
	
	* filter.h: getCropInformation. Adding declaration.
	
	* tiff.c: readTIFF.  Storing filename of TIFF in im->name.
	
	* panorama.h: Adding CropInfo struct...used for processed cropped images

	* pt_stdint.h: Fixing bad CR/LF combinations
        	

2006-05-24  dmg  <dmgerman@uvic.ca>

	* PTcommon.c (TiffSetImageParameters, TiffGetImageParameters):
	Make sure ROWSPERSTRIP is propagated.

2006-05-23  dmg  <dmgerman@uvic.ca>

	* PTcommon.c (TiffGetImageParameters, TiffSetImageParameters):
	Make sure compression is propagated at further stages
	(CreatePanorama): Implemented support for C:NONE 
	(CreatePanorama): Implemented support for C:DEFLATE 
	(ComputeStitchingMask8bits): Removed redundant code.

2006-05-22  dmg  <dmgerman@uvic.ca>

	* PTcommon.c: Checked return value of each TIFFWriteScanline. It
	now returns an error when it cannot write to the output (instead of
	just continue blindly). Added Error and Warning handler for TIFF
	library so the errors are now reported using the PTtools error
	handler.
	(CreatePSD): Make sure PSD is 8 bit if it contains more than 1
	layer (we do not support multi-layer 16bit images). Cleaned up the
	function and added some comments.
	(ComputeStitchingMask8bits): Cleanedup the function (still more
	work to do)

2006-05-20  dmg  <dmgerman@uvic.ca>

	* PTcommon.c (CreatePanorama): Fixed a bug in TIFF_mask (the
	program was not ending after where it should have)

2006-05-15  dmg  <dmgerman@uvic.ca>

	* PTcommon.c (CreatePanorama): Fixed a typo related to QTVR
	images. I also renamed Unknown07 to Create_QTVR

	* resample.c: Fixed compilation warnings by moving #define
	unsigned inside the body of the functions.

2006-05-16 Max Lyons (maxlyons@tawbaware.com)

	* resample.c: Fixing bug in fast transform logic that caused crash when 
	destRect.left != 0 (i.e. producing cropped TIFF output)

2006-05-15 Max Lyons (maxlyons@tawbaware.com)

	* Removed old versions of ptcommon and colourbrightness from the 
	tools...these had already been moved into libpano main directory

	* Updated Makefile.win32 to include missing references to sys_common.c, 
	PTCommon.c, hdrfile.c, rgbe.c, ColourBrightness.c...should now build 
	correctly using MingW

	* pano12.def: Removed duplicate entry for "StringtoFullPath" 
	(exported twice).

	* PTcommon.c: Changed #include <filter.h> to #include "filter.h" (this 
	prevented compilation with MingW)

	* PTcommon.c: Changed call to execute_stack to execute_stack_new (necessary 
	as a result of modification to Transformation function type)

	* PTcommon.c: Removed InsertFileName definition.  This is already defined 
	in PTPicker, and prevented compilation with MingW.

	* ColourBrightness.c: Changed #include <filter.h> to #include "filter.h" 
	(this prevented compilation with MingW)

	* PTBlender: Fixed comparison between pointer and integer error (line 102)

2006-05-07  dmg  <dmgerman@uvic.ca>

	* version.h: Updated version to 2.8.3
