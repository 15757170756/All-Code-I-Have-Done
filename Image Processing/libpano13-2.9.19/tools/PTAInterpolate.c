/*
 *  Author: Max Lyons, January 2007
 *
 *  Description: This program is an enhanced version of Helmut Dersch's
 *  original PTInterpolate program.  PTInterpolate's source code was never
 *  released, so this program was written from scratch.  It is believed that 
 *  this program should function as a substitute for the original PTInterpolate 
 *  program in most circumstances.  Enhancements to the original PTInterpolate 
 *  program include:
 *
 *  1. When used with the accompanying source code in the original distribution, 
 *     the output is in TIFF format, not PSD (with an incorrect extension)
 *  2. The output files produced by this program include a numeric value
 *     indicating the amount of the interplation position between left and 
 *     right images
 *  3. If no valid "i" lines are included in script, then this program
 *     triangulates the c lines, and ovrewrites the script file
 * 
 *  Usage:
 *    
 *    PTAInterpolate.exe script.txt [param2]
 *
 *  Where "param2" is either an image index (0=left, 1=right) to be used when 
 *     triangulating, or a filename prefix to be used when interpolating.
