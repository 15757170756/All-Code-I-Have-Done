This directory contains various stuff that is used when building
software from CVS. So far, it contains:

- some auxiliary scripts that are used when using libtool, for things
  that libtool doesn't handle currently.

In order to generate DLLs with version resources included (a nice
touch, and more Windows style), we need support for compiling and
including resources with DLL version number. Currently this knowledge
is not in libtool, but in the compile-resource and lt-compile-resource
scripts here in the win32 subdirectory.

These were originally from the GNOME project.
